            <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore where the design works well and where
                it can be improved. We focus our process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
                design more efficient?”</p>

            <h2>A picture is worth a thousand words</h2>
            <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you what can be improved but also make
                revamps to the most critical parts of the design.</p>
            <h2>Design Report</h2>
            <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and provide a detailed visual report with
                useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting point for further work on the design.</p>
            <h2>Ways to Redesign</h2>
            <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end
                agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick
                but effective improvements.</p>
